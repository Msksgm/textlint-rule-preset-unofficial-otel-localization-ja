# textlint-rule-preset-unofficial-otel-localization-ja

## About

It is **unofficial** otel localization ja textlint rule preset directory.
It is created to make my personal Japanese translation activity more efficient.
I hope that a similar setting will be included in [open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io) in the future.
